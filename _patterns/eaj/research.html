  <p class="milli push-1-2">The eaJ platform is the brainchild of Jae Park (widely known as Jae of Day6).</p>
  <p class="milli push-1-2">However, the eaJ project is his exploration of independent music projects, and as such, is deeply linked to Jae as an individual. Thus, <b>the concepts for the logos are centred on key components of Jaeâ€™s life, interests, and musical works under eaJ.</b></p>
  <p class="milli push-1-2">An icon and word mark combination logo provided the most visual flexibility, and became the foundation for many of the concepts that were delivered.</p>
  <p class="milli push-0">The target demographic for this project was identified as primarily English-speaking. Therefore, these concepts continue to <b>employ an English word mark (Jae, backwards), to better facilitate brand continuity.</b></p>
