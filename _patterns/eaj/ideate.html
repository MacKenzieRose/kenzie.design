<p class="milli push-1-2">Inspiration for the eaJ rebrand narrowed to three, focussed themes:</p>
<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>Places:</b> pairing the introspective nature of eaJ’s music with his ability to capture the essence of places in his videography work. As eaJ writes, “what you see depends from where.”</p>
<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>Lyricism:</b> focussing on Rose, one of eaJ’s most well-loved works, which reflects his keen insight into his fans’ pathos, to create floral imagery. </p>
<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>Rebirth:</b> blending new beginnings with imagery fans associate with Jae. This includes details like his favourite colour (yellow), and references to the character Chicken Little, that have endeared Jae to his audience.</p>
