<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>How do you design a logo for someone you've never spoken to, without a creative brief, in a weekend?</b> In early July of 2020, eaJ (a not-for-profit music project) made a call for logo and banner work, with particular respect to YouTube.</p>
<p class="milli push-0">Although my bid was ultimately unsuccessful (check out the official branding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrOUYIN9rbYaWFs68vAtaZA">here!</a>) participating was a great, albeit impromptu, experience that resulted in some neat work. Enjoy!</p>
