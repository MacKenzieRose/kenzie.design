<p class="milli push-1-2">Cate works on 3 basic principles.</p>
<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>1. Users will be able to use Cate to communicate. </b> This supports non-fluent aphasia, and incorporates many industry standard practices, including pairing imagery with words, and speech board methodology. The general idea is to support production of sentences and ideas, by providing common words/phrases, and organizing them intelligently for the user. This often also incorporates text-to-speech;</p>

<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>2. Users will be able to practice and improve their speech with Cate.</b> Many speech therapy exercises are based on repetition and practice of phoneme and morpheme retention. This information and instruction can be converted to digital forms, so users can access these kinds of resources and exercises at home; </p>

<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>3. Users will be able to connect with others through Cate.</b> Many aphasia applications offer messaging and video integrations to promote community and support. This could also extend to care providers, especially in COVID times, as well as emergency services.</p>
