brief: |
  Jina Kim is a content creator on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/itsjinakim">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsjinakim/">Instagram</a> making fashion and lifestyle videos with respect to Korean culture. She wanted to <b>refresh her branding, but stay true to her fanbase.</b>
  <p class="milli push-1-2">Here’s a snapshot of how the branding looked in 2019:</p>

research: |
  The very beginning of this process involved an analysis of all available and relevant digital engagement metrics.
  <p class="milli">From this research, four key pieces about her brand, content, and audience were identified:</p>
  <ul class="milli push-0">
    <li class="push-1-2">Her audience <b>values her honesty</b></li>
    <li class="push-1-2">Her viewership is <b>international</b>, and the core audience is <b>very dedicated</b></li>
    <li class="push-1-2">Korean content and keywords work really well to <b>encourage views and new subscriptions</b> to her channel</li>
    <li class="push-0">K-pop and dating-type content is <b>consistently, and sustainably popular</b></li>
  </ul>

  Three different avenues for a word mark were considered in this stage:
  <p class="push-0 milli">A sharp, geometric word mark that could be deconstructed to <b>write Jina in both English and Korean;</b></p>

  <p class="push-0 milli">A handwritten-style word mark, that would mimic the brand name as a signature, <b>based on Jina’s handwriting;</b> and</p>
  <img src="/images/jina-kim/ideate2.jpg" class="img-flex pad-b pad-t" alt="Second word mark concept, featuring a handwriting sample from Jina">
  <p class="push-0 milli">A word mark based on an existing font, <b>styled with individual customized attributes</b> to make it her own.</p>

  <b>The signature style was the winner amongst the logo concepts.</b> After several iterations, it evolved into the word mark that represents Jina’s brand today:
  <p class="milli">Before the final hand-off, a review of existing domestic trademarks was also conducted for Jina. This was to ensure every effort was made to give her the option of trademarking her logo.</p>
  <p class="milli">The time from initial consultation to the final product was just under four weeks, and happily, the final product was well-received by both Jina and her audience.</p>

finalproduct: |
  The finalized logo for Jina’s brand is rhythmic, feminine, and clean. The wave-like qualities make it visually consistent and calming, and resemble Jina’s oceanic hometown of Incheon.
  <p class="push-0 milli">We kept the logo simple, to make it more accessible for an international audience. It also meets the minimum width specifications for embroidery, which was an extremely important consideration for Jina’s clothing line.</p>
