brief: |
  <b>The key to a successful rebranding is finding the delicate balance between where a brand has been, and the places it wants to go.</b>
  <p class="milli push-1-2">As a content creator on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/itsjinakim">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itsjinakim/">Instagram</a>, it was clear that Jina wanted to give her branding new life, but to stay true to her fanbase. Here’s a snapshot of how the branding looked in 2019:</p>

research: |
  Like all good designers do, we started with researching all of the available digital metrics for the Jina Kim brand.
  <p class="milli push-1-2">The analysis of this data told us a lot, including that:</p>
  <ul class="milli push-0">
    <li class="push-1-2">Her audience <b>values her honesty</b></li>
    <li class="push-1-2">Her viewership is <b>international</b>, and the core audience is <b>very dedicated</b></li>
    <li class="push-1-2">Korean content and keywords work really well to <b>encourage views and new subscriptions</b> to her channel</li>
    <li class="push-0">K-pop and dating content is <b>consistently, and sustainably popular</b></li>
  </ul>

  Three different avenues for a word mark were considered in this stage:
  <p class="push-0 milli">A sharp, geometric word mark that could be deconstructed to <b>write Jina in both English and Korean;</b></p>

  <p class="push-0 milli">A handwritten-style word mark, that would mimic the brand name as a signature, <b>based on Jina’s handwriting;</b> and</p>

  <p class="push-0 milli">A word mark based on an existing font, <b>styled with individual customized attributes</b> to make it her own.</p>

  <b>The signature style was the winner amongst the logo concepts.</b> After several iterations, it evolved into the word mark that represents Jina’s brand today:
  <p class="milli push-1-2">Before the final hand-off, <b>a review of existing domestic trademarks</b> was also conducted for Jina. This was to ensure every effort was made to give her the option of trademarking her logo.</p>
  <p class="milli push-1-2"><b>The time from the initial consultation to the final product was just under four weeks,</b> and happily, was well-received by both Jina and her audience.</p>

  The finalized logo was built to be rhythmic, feminine, and clean. The wave-like qualities resemble Jina’s oceanic hometown of Incheon, and have a very calming quality to them.
  <p class="push-0 milli">We kept the logo simple, to make it accessible for her very international audience. The wordmark also meets the minimum width specifications for embroidery, which was an extremely important consideration for Jina’s clothing line.</p>
