brief: |
  <b>Q: What do you get when you cross Photoshop and fandom?</b> A: An inordinate amount of creative freedom, and potentially some pretty cool posters.
  <p class="milli push-0">This project promoted the latest mini-album release from musical group Adventure Calling Emotions (A.C.E) in early fall of 2020. The goal was to produce digital and print-ready advertisements, and was conducted in partnership with A.C.E’s fandom, Choice.</p>
research: |
  Data from an August 2020 survey of Choice was reviewed, and the following observations were made:
  <ul class="milli">
  	<li class="push-1-2"><b>Choice are primarily female</b>, and are extremely diverse living all over the world. They are <b>often multilingual.</b></li>
    <li>More than 30% of the fanbase has been involved in supporting A.C.E since 2017, and have <b>strong brand loyalty</b>. The vast majority of Choice are <b>single, and aged 16–35.</b> They typically have access to more liquid assets, but are extremely <b>unwilling to pay high shipping costs.</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="milli push-0">This data was primarily sampled from native English speakers, and thus was not representative of the entire market; however, it served to <b>better identify the kinds of users who would positively engage with the ads.</b></p>

  As such, the development of promotional materials began. The plan evolved into compositing the following promotional photos into a movie-style poster.
  <p class="milli push-1-2">This was important because:</p>
  <ul class="milli">
    <li class="push-1-2">Image-first strategies widely <b>appeal to younger audiences;</b> and</li>
    <li>Having <b>less text minimizes barriers</b> to independent translation efforts.</li>
  </ul>

  Ultimately, the final versions of the posters featured the album title <i>The Butterfly Phantasy</i> in its original <i>Hanja</i> (Chinese) form, and focused primarily on the photographic imagery elements from official promotions.
  <p class="milli push-0">Although there was some variation by platform, this was the final, general-use digital poster:</p>

  Twitter promotions for this project received <b>over 42,000 impressions, and more than 12,000 engagements.</b> The Bangkok promotions via Instagram had <b>nearly 16,000 impressions,</b> and meaningfully <b>reached over 13,000 of those users.</b>
  <p class="milli">Both existing and new users responded positively to the promotions. Although this project was only a small piece of the puzzle, it is with great enthusiasm that I can report the title track music video, Favorite Boys, reached <b>3 million views in 13 days — a new record for growth.</b></p>
  <h3 class="kilo push-0">Next Steps</h3>
  <p class="milli push-1-2">This project is also currently being used to <b>develop mobile AR interactive promotional prototypes</b> as a proof-of-concept for future promotions and analytics.</p>
  <p class="milli push-0">AR integration is an emerging solution in A.C.E’s industry, and will help them to stand apart from their peers. By adding extra interactivity, <b>user engagement is expected to increase.</b></p>
