		<p class="milli push-1-2">I'm a graphic design student in my final year of studies in Ottawa, Canada. I love early mornings, black coffee, and most importantly, YouTube reaction and analysis videos.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">Apart from my regular design work, I also dabble in coding. I'm still building this site, so you're getting a sneak preview-- no extra charge. If you check out the <a href="/index/">Projects</a> page, you'll find a few examples of my work. <b>Feel free to look around!</b></p>

		<h3 class="push-1-2 pad-t">Great design is all about <span style="color: var(--color-accent)">empathy.</span></h3>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">If you can place yourself in your audience's shoes, you have the chance to create something that resonates.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>Making something look good is just a small part of design;</b> my real goal as a designer is to make things, that make you feel things.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">If you take a look at my work, you'll see I have a lot to say. Making work intentionally — based on real data and user insights — is extremely important to me. Accessibility is huge too.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">Don't get me wrong. I love the final stages of design where you see the work finally come together; but <b>my focus is making use of opportunities to meaningfully connect clients and their users.</b></p>

		<h2 class="push-1-2">So why should you hire me?</h2>
		<p class="milli push-1-2 bold">I'll be real with you, PD. I'm a UI / UX, branding, strategic marketing, web design, photo-retouching kinda girl.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">If you're looking for someone who's really into illustration, animation, and motion graphics, I'm not the designer for you.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">But, if you've come this far, even if you don't need my skillset right now, let me give you a few more reasons to keep me in mind.</p>

		<h4 class="push-0 text-center">I'm a still a student.</h4>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">I know it would be dope to have 10+ years of industry experience, but I'm not there (yet). What I can tell you is I'm flexible, enthusiastic, and extremely receptive to feedback. I've still got lots of room to grow as a designer, so what you see isn't my best work-- it's just where I've been so far.</p>
		<p class="push milli">Also, did I mention I'm Canadian? Let those currency conversion rates work in your favour!</p>
		<h4 class="push-0 text-center">Remote work is kind of the best.</h4>
		<p class="push milli">I can't say a global pandemic was the ideal way to find out I like working from home, but it turns out, I'm actually pretty good at it. If I have clear tasks and deadlines, I get things done. I'm good with email, Zoom, Slack, Google Drive; wherever & whatever you're using, I can accommodate.</p>
		<h4 class="push-0 text-center">I jive with your content.</h4>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">If you look at the <a href="/index/">case studies</a> I've written so far, you'll see that I've consistently fallen into projects for K-pop and YouTube. I can't say they make me perfectly qualified for the job, but I do have at least some background to inform design work in those contexts.</p>
		<p class="push milli">I also have a background in music, which is part of the reason I was first drawn to your channel. I know music production and performance aren't identical, but between that and a genuine interest in K-pop and K-culture, I've tagged along for a lot of your work. Your videos have given a lot to me, and I'd love an opportunity to give you something back.</p>
		<h4 class="push-0 text-center">I value people who value their craft.</h4>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">The truth is that you work on cool projects, have neat ideas, and I want to be a part of it. I have a lot of respect for the way you construct your ideas, and how you generally conduct yourself.</p>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">Hearing you talk about why you started making videos, and why you'll keep going despite content blocks, is why I decided to apply for this. Even if my work isn't your cup of coffee, I hope you'll hold onto the fact that some chick in Canada is sincerely cheering you on as a fellow creator.</p>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">If reaction videos can have cultural significance so, too, can design work. And if design is anything like my favourite movies, it's better when the experience is shared with someone else.</p>
		<p class="milli push">Let's make something significant, together!</p>
