##**Hi! I'm MacKenzie.**

I’m a graphic designer currently based in Ottawa. 

From concept to creation, my focus is the digital realm, where I build user experiences, websites, and strategic brands that spark joy. I’m a technical creative, a solver of problems, and am extremely passionate about visual solutions that enable accessibility and opportunity. 

When I’m not designing, you can find me reading, hiking, and learning new languages.

Let’s make something wonderful together!
