		<p class="milli push-1-2">I'm a graphic design student in my final year of studies in Ottawa, Canada. I love early mornings, black coffee, and most importantly, getting things done.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">Apart from my regular design work, I also dabble in coding. I'm still building this site, so you're getting a sneak preview-- no extra charge. If you check out the <a href="/index/">Projects</a> page, you'll find a few examples of my work. <b>Feel free to look around!</b></p>

		<p class="milli push-1-2">If you can place yourself in your audience's shoes, you have the chance to create something that resonates.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2"><b>Making something look good is just a small part of design;</b> my real goal as a designer is to make things, that make you feel things.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">If you take a look at my work, you'll see I have a lot to say. Creating work intentionally — based on real data and user insights — is extremely important to me. Accessibility is huge too.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">Don't get me wrong. I love the final stages of design where you see the work finally come together; but <b>my focus is making use of opportunities to meaningfully connect clients and their users.</b></p>

		<h2 class="push-1-2">So why work with me?</h2>
		<p class="milli push-1-2 bold">I'll be real with you. I've grown into a UI / UX, branding, strategic marketing, web design, photo-retouching kinda girl.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">If you're looking for someone who's really into illustration, animation, and motion graphics, I'm not the designer for you.</p>
		<p class="milli push-1-2">But outside of design, let me recap some other things that are probably good to know about working with me:</p>

		<h4 class="push-0 text-center">I'm still a student.</h4>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">I know it would be dope to have 10+ years of industry experience, but I'm not there (yet). What I can tell you is I'm flexible, enthusiastic, and extremely receptive to feedback. I've still got lots of room to grow as a designer, so what you see isn't my best work-- it's just where I've been so far.</p>
		<h4 class="push-0 text-center">Remote work is kind of the best.</h4>
		<p class="push milli">I can't say a global pandemic was the ideal way to find out I like working from home, but it turns out, I'm actually pretty good at it. If I have clear tasks and deadlines, I get things done. I'm good with email, Zoom, Slack, Google Drive; wherever & whatever you're using, I can accommodate.</p>
		<h4 class="push-0 text-center">I jive with your leadership.</h4>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">It's been a while since we last worked together, and I can see how much things have evolved since then. However, I'm still confident the time I previously spent working with you will serve to inform my work as a placement student. Your management style and communication skills bring out the best in me, and I can't express enough how excited I am to work with you again.</p>
		<p class="push milli">I'm happy to report I'm still passionate about projects that create community, that encourage people to connect with one another, and that facilitate exploration. I'm also determined to create systems and assets that will save you time, and let you work on other projects.</p>
		<h4 class="push-0 text-center">I value people who value their craft.</h4>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">The truth is that you work on cool projects, have neat ideas, and I want to be a part of it. I have a lot of respect for the way you manage teams, and how you generally conduct yourself.</p>
		<p class="push-1-2 milli">Learning your story about building QueensEvents from the ground up, and knowing firsthand the impact those kinds of experiences can have, is what first drew me to apply to work with you. I'm excited that, years later, I'm bringing a completely new skillset to the table.</p>
		<p class="milli push">Let's make something significant, together!</p>
